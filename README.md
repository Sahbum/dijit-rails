# Dijit with Ruby on Rails

If you want to use Dijit (a Dojo Toolkit component) with Ruby on Rails, this gem is certainly the answer to your problem. There is no real implementation of Dojo and its components for Rails so this gem should make you smile. Please also see [dojo-rails](https://github.com/robin850/dojo-rails) and [dojox-rails](https://github.com/robin850/dojox-rails).

## Setup

Just open your application's `Gemfile` and edit it adding the gem:

```ruby
gem 'dojo-rails'
gem 'dijit-rails'
```

Just run the `bundle` comand yo install it. Then in your javascript/Coffeescript file, you can add Dijit packages to your require package list just like that:

```coffeescript
require ["dijit/Editor"], (editor) ->
  # ... your code
```

## Usage with Asset Pipeline in Production

To use with production and asset pipeline from Rails 3.1 you will need to have the [djConfig](http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.8/dojo_config/) hash set before you load the dojo/dojo library

*This is critical for production mode because otherwise the require[ ] statements will not load libraries correctly*

Example contents of application.js
```coffeescript
//= require dojo_config
//= require dojo/dojo
```
Contents of dojo_config.js
```javascript
dojoConfig = {
  baseUrl: '/assets/dojo/'
};
```
